# 3.3 Merging Strategies

Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Git has two primary ways to do this, depending on the commit history of the branches involved: a **fast-forward merge** and a **three-way merge**.

---

### Fast-Forward Merge

A "fast-forward" merge happens when the branch you are merging into has not diverged from the branch you are merging. In other words, there's a direct, linear path from the target branch's tip to the source branch's tip.

**Scenario:**
1. You create a new branch `feature-a` from `main`.
2. You make a few commits on `feature-a`.
3. In the meantime, no new commits have been made on `main`.

```
A --- B --- C (main)
             \
              D --- E (feature-a)
```

When you merge `feature-a` into `main`, Git simply moves the `main` pointer forward to point to commit `E`. No new "merge commit" is created.

**How to perform:**
```bash
# Switch to the receiving branch
git switch main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature-a
```
The result is a clean, linear history.

### Three-Way Merge (Recursive Merge)

A "three-way merge" is necessary when the branches have diverged. This means there have been new commits on **both** branches since they last shared a common ancestor.

**Scenario:**
1. You create a new branch `feature-b` from `main`.
2. You make commits on `feature-b`.
3. Meanwhile, someone else makes new commits on `main`.

```
A --- B --- C --- F (main)
             \
              D --- E (feature-b)
```

When you merge `feature-b` into `main`, Git can't just move the pointer. Instead, it performs a three-way merge by looking at three commits:
1. The common ancestor (`C`).
2. The tip of the target branch (`F`).
3. The tip of the source branch (`E`).

Git then creates a brand new **merge commit** (`M`) that has two parents (`F` and `E`), combining the work from both branches.

```
A --- B --- C --- F --- M (main)
             \       /
              D --- E (feature-b)
```

**How to perform:**
```bash
# Switch to the receiving branch
git switch main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature-b
```
This is the most common type of merge in collaborative projects. It preserves the history of both branches and explicitly shows where they were joined together.
