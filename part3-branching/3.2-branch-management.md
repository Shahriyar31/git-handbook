# 3.2 Branch Management

Git provides a simple set of commands for creating, listing, switching between, and deleting branches.

### `git branch`: Listing, Creating, and Deleting

The `git branch` command is your primary tool for managing branches.

**1. List All Local Branches:**
Simply run the command by itself. The current branch will be marked with an asterisk (`*`).
```bash
git branch
```
Output:
```
* main
  feature/user-login
```

**2. Create a New Branch:**
This creates a new branch pointer at your current commit, but **does not** switch to it.
```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
```
Example:
```bash
git branch feature/user-profile
```

**3. Delete a Branch:**
You can delete a branch that has been fully merged into your current branch.
```bash
git branch -d <branch-to-delete>
```
To **force delete** a branch (even if it has unmerged changes), use the `-D` flag. Use this with caution, as you could lose work!
```bash
git branch -D <branch-to-delete>
```

### `git switch`: Switching Between Branches (Modern)

Introduced in Git 2.23, `git switch` is the modern and safer way to change branches.

**1. Switch to an Existing Branch:**
```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```
Example:
```bash
git switch feature/user-profile
```

**2. Create and Switch to a New Branch:**
This is a very common workflow. The `-c` flag creates the new branch and immediately switches to it.
```bash
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```
Example:
```bash
git switch -c bugfix/css-alignment
```

### `git checkout`: The Older Way

Before `git switch`, the `git checkout` command was used for changing branches. While `git switch` is now preferred for clarity, you will see `git checkout` used very frequently in older projects and tutorials.

* **Switching branches:** `git checkout <branch-name>`
* **Creating and switching:** `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`

The `checkout` command is still useful for other tasks, like restoring files, but for changing branches, `switch` is the recommended modern practice.
