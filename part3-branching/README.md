# Part 3: Git Branching & Merging Deep Dive

Welcome to Part 3! If `git commit` is the heart of Git, then `git branch` is its soul. Branching is arguably Git's most powerful feature, allowing you to work on multiple features or fixes in parallel without affecting the main codebase.

In this section, we will explore how to create, manage, and delete branches. We'll cover different merging strategies, learn how to handle more complex conflicts, and introduce powerful (but advanced) concepts like rebasing and stashing. Mastering this section will elevate your Git skills from basic use to true proficiency.
