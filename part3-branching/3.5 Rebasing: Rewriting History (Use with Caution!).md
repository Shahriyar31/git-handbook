# 3.5 Rebasing: Rewriting History (Use with Caution!)

Rebasing is one of Git's most powerful features, but it's also one of the most dangerous if used incorrectly. Its primary purpose is to rewrite commit history to create a cleaner, more linear project history.

---

### What is Rebasing?

`git rebase` essentially takes a series of commits from one branch and "replays" them, one by one, on top of another branch. Instead of creating a merge commit, it makes it look as if you had created your branch from a more recent point in time.

**Scenario (Before Rebase):**
Your `feature` branch has diverged from `main`.
```
A --- B --- C --- F (main)
             \
              D --- E (feature)
```

**After Rebasing `feature` onto `main`:**
The commits `D` and `E` are replayed on top of `F`, creating new commits `D'` and `E'`. The history is now linear.
```
A --- B --- C --- F (main)
                   \
                    D'--- E' (feature)
```

**How to Perform a Rebase:**
1.  Switch to the branch you want to replay:
    ```bash
    git switch feature
    ```
2.  Run the rebase command with the target branch:
    ```bash
    git rebase main
    ```
If conflicts occur during the rebase, Git will pause at each conflicting commit. You'll need to resolve the conflict, `git add` the resolved file, and then run `git rebase --continue`. To cancel the rebase, run `git rebase --abort`.

### The Golden Rule of Rebase

> **Never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a public or shared branch.**

This is the most important rule. Rebasing rewrites history by creating new commits and abandoning the old ones. If you rebase commits that other people have already pulled and are basing their work on, you will cause significant problems for them. Their history will no longer match the rewritten history, leading to complex merge issues.

**When is it safe to rebase?**
* On your own local feature branches that you have not yet pushed to the remote.
* To clean up your own messy commits *before* you share them with others (e.g., before creating a pull request).

---

### Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)

Interactive rebase is even more powerful. It allows you to modify a series of commits before they are replayed. You can reorder, edit, combine (`squash`), or delete commits. This is an excellent tool for cleaning up your local history before pushing.

**How to use:**
To edit the last 3 commits, for example:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
This will open your text editor with a list of the commits and instructions on how to modify them.

### Rebase vs. Merge

* **`git merge`**: Preserves the exact history as it happened. It's safe for shared branches because it doesn't rewrite history. It can, however, create a "messy" graph with many merge commits.
* **`git rebase`**: Creates a clean, linear history. It's great for keeping your feature branches updated with `main` and for cleaning up local commits. It's dangerous on shared branches.

Many teams use a workflow where developers rebase their feature branches on `main` locally, and then use a merge (often via a pull request) to integrate the feature into `main`.
