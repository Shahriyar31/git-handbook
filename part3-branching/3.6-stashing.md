# 3.6 Stashing Changes (`git stash`)

Sometimes, you're in the middle of working on something, your working directory is messy with uncommitted changes, and you suddenly need to switch to another branch to fix an urgent bug. You don't want to commit your unfinished work, but you also don't want to lose it.

`git stash` is your solution. It temporarily saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) and reverts your working directory to a clean state (matching the last commit).

### How to Use `git stash`

#### 1. Save Your Changes (`git stash`)

When your working directory is "dirty," simply run:
```bash
git stash
```
You can also provide a descriptive message, which is highly recommended:
```bash
git stash save "WIP: Implementing user profile form"
```
After stashing, your working directory will be clean. Run `git status` to confirm. You are now free to switch branches.

#### 2. View Your Stashes (`git stash list`)

You can save multiple stashes. To see a list of all your saved stashes:
```bash
git stash list
```
Output:
```
stash@{0}: On feature/profile: WIP: Implementing user profile form
stash@{1}: On main: Quick fix for header
```
The most recent stash is always `stash@{0}`.

#### 3. Re-apply Your Stashed Changes

Once you're ready to continue your work, switch back to your original branch and re-apply your stashed changes.

**`git stash apply`**:
This applies the changes from the most recent stash but **leaves the stash on the list**. This is useful if you want to apply the same stash to multiple branches.
```bash
git stash apply
```
To apply a specific stash from the list:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

**`git stash pop`**:
This is the most common command. It applies the changes from the most recent stash and then **removes that stash from the list**.
```bash
git stash pop
```

#### 4. Delete Stashes

If you no longer need a stash, you can delete it.

* **Delete a specific stash:** `git stash drop stash@{1}`
* **Delete all stashes:** `git stash clear` (Use with caution!)
