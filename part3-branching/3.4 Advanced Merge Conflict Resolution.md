# 3.4 Advanced Merge Conflict Resolution

In Part 2, we covered how to manually resolve conflicts by editing the markers Git places in your files. For more complex conflicts, Git provides tools to make this process easier and more reliable.

### Using a Graphical Merge Tool

Manually editing files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers can be confusing. Git allows you to configure an external merge tool that provides a graphical interface for resolving conflicts.

**Common Tools:**
* **VS Code (Built-in):** If you use Visual Studio Code, it has excellent built-in merge conflict resolution. When you open a conflicted file, it will show clear buttons to "Accept Current Change," "Accept Incoming Change," or "Accept Both Changes."
* **Meld, KDiff3, Beyond Compare:** These are dedicated graphical tools you can download and configure Git to use.

**How to Use a Merge Tool:**

1.  **Configure the Tool (One-time setup):**
    You need to tell Git which tool you want to use. For example, to set VS Code as your default:
    ```bash
    git config --global merge.tool "vscode"
    git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd "code --wait $MERGED"
    ```

2.  **Launch the Tool:**
    After a merge conflict occurs, instead of opening the file manually, run:
    ```bash
    git mergetool
    ```
    Git will then launch your configured tool for each conflicted file. The tool will typically show a three-way comparison: your version, the incoming version, and the common ancestor, allowing you to easily see the differences and choose how to combine them.

3.  **Commit the Resolution:**
    Once you save and close the merge tool for a file, Git often automatically stages it for you. After resolving all conflicts, you can complete the merge with `git commit`.

### Helpful Commands During a Conflict

When you're in the middle of a conflict, these commands can help you understand the situation.

* **`git status`**: As always, this is your primary tool. It will clearly list which files are in a conflicted, "unmerged" state.

* **`git diff`**: This command will show you the differences between the conflicting versions in a standard diff format, highlighting the specific lines that are in conflict.

* **`git log --merge`**: This shows only the commits that are involved in the current merge conflict (i.e., the commits on both branches since they diverged). This helps you understand the history and context of the conflicting changes.

* **`git checkout --conflict=diff3`**: This command re-displays the conflict markers in a file but adds a third section showing the "common ancestor" version. This can be very helpful for understanding *why* a conflict occurred.
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Your version
    ||||||| merged common ancestors
    The original version
    =======
    The incoming version
    >>>>>>> other-branch
    ```
