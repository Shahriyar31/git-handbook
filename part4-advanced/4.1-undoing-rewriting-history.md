# 4.1 Undoing & Rewriting History (More Advanced)

We've already covered basic ways to undo changes. Now, let's explore the powerful commands `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git cherry-pick`. Understanding when and how to use them is crucial for managing a clean and accurate project history.

### `git reset`: Moving the HEAD Pointer (Use with Caution!)

`git reset` is a powerful command that moves the current `HEAD` (and the branch it's on) to a specified commit, effectively "undoing" any commits that came after it. Its behavior varies significantly based on the mode you use.

#### `git reset --soft <commit>`
* **What it does:** Moves `HEAD` to the specified commit.
* **Staging Area:** The changes from the undone commits are moved to the staging area.
* **Working Directory:** Unchanged.
* **Use Case:** You want to un-commit your last few commits but keep all the changes staged and ready to be re-committed as a single new commit.

#### `git reset --mixed <commit>` (This is the default mode)
* **What it does:** Moves `HEAD` to the specified commit.
* **Staging Area:** Unstaged. The changes from the undone commits are moved to the working directory.
* **Working Directory:** Unchanged.
* **Use Case:** You want to un-commit and also un-stage all your recent changes, so you can re-evaluate what to include in your next commit.

#### `git reset --hard <commit>`
* **What it does:** Moves `HEAD` to the specified commit.
* **Staging Area:** Cleared.
* **Working Directory:** **All changes are discarded.** Your files will exactly match the state of the target commit.
* **Use Case:** You want to completely and permanently throw away all recent commits and any uncommitted work. **This is a destructive command and can lead to lost work if not used carefully.**

### `git revert`: Safely Undoing a Public Commit

`git revert` is the safe way to undo changes that have already been pushed to a shared branch. Instead of deleting commits from history, it creates a **new commit** that introduces the inverse of the changes from a previous commit.

**How it works:**
If an old commit added a line of code, `git revert` will create a new commit that removes that line.

**Why it's safe:**
Because it doesn't rewrite history, it won't cause problems for collaborators who have already pulled the original commit. The project history clearly shows that a change was made and then later undone.

**How to use:**
```bash
# Find the hash of the commit you want to undo
git log

# Create a new commit that reverts the changes from the old commit
git revert <commit_hash_to_revert>
```

### The Golden Rule: `reset` vs. `revert`

* Use **`git reset`** on commits in your **local, private history** that you have not yet shared with others.
* Use **`git revert`** on commits that have already been **pushed to a public, shared branch**.

### `git cherry-pick`: Applying a Single Commit

`git cherry-pick` allows you to pick a single commit from one branch and apply it onto another.

**Scenario:**
You fixed a critical bug on a feature branch, but the rest of the feature isn't ready. You want to get just that one bug-fix commit into your `main` branch immediately.

**How to use:**
1.  On your feature branch, find the hash of the specific commit you want:
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
2.  Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commit:
    ```bash
    git switch main
    ```
3.  Cherry-pick the commit:
    ```bash
    git cherry-pick <hash_of_bug_fix_commit>
    ```
Git will create a new commit on `main` that introduces the exact same changes as the original commit from your feature branch.
