# Part 4: Advanced Git Concepts & Workflows

Welcome to Part 4. Now that you have a solid understanding of branching and merging, we can explore some of Git's more powerful (and sometimes more complex) features.

This section is for users who want to truly master Git. We will cover advanced history manipulation techniques like `reset`, `revert`, and `cherry-pick`. We'll also look under the hood at Git's internal workings, learn how to automate tasks with Git Hooks, and discuss common team workflows that structure collaboration on a larger scale.
