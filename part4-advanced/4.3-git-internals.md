# 4.3 Git Internals (Briefly)

While you don't need to be an expert in Git's internal workings to use it effectively, understanding the basic concepts can help you understand *why* certain commands work the way they do.

At its core, Git is a **content-addressable filesystem**. This means that at the heart of Git is a simple key-value data store. You can insert any kind of content, and it will give you back a unique key (a SHA-1 hash) that you can use to retrieve the content later.

### The `.git` Directory

Everything Git does is stored in the `.git` directory at the root of your project. The most important components are:

* **`objects/`**: This is the database for all your content. Every version of every file, every commit, and every tree structure is stored here as an "object," identified by its unique SHA-1 hash.
* **`refs/`**: This directory contains the pointers to your commits. Your branches are stored in `refs/heads/` and your tags in `refs/tags/`. A branch is simply a file containing the SHA-1 hash of the commit it points to.
* **`HEAD`**: This is a special file that contains a pointer to the branch you are currently on. It's how Git knows where to save your next commit.
* **`index`**: This file represents your staging area. It's a complex binary file that lists all the files in your current branch, their SHA-1 hashes, and their timestamps.

### Git's Core Objects

Git primarily uses three types of objects to build its history:

1.  **Blob (Binary Large Object):** This object stores the contents of a file. It contains no metadata like the filename or timestamp—only the data itself.
2.  **Tree:** A tree object represents a directory. It contains a list of pointers to blobs (for files in the directory) and other tree objects (for subdirectories). Each pointer includes the SHA-1 hash, filename, and mode.
3.  **Commit:** A commit object points to a single tree object, representing the state of the project at that point in time. It also contains metadata like the parent commit(s), the author, the committer, and the commit message.

### The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Git's history is not a simple linear list; it's a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.
* **Directed:** Each commit points directly to its parent(s).
* **Acyclic:** You can never have a cycle. A commit cannot be its own ancestor.
* **Graph:** The network of commits, connected by parent-child relationships, forms a graph. Merges create commits with multiple parents, which is what gives the graph its shape.

This graph structure is what allows Git to perform powerful branching and merging operations so efficiently.
