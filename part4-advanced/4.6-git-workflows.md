# 4.6 Git Workflows (Overview)

While Git provides the tools, a "workflow" provides a strategic approach for how your team uses those tools. A consistent workflow ensures everyone understands how to collaborate, leading to a more efficient process and a cleaner project history.

Here is an overview of some of the most popular Git workflows.

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow

This is one of a very common and straightforward workflow. The core idea is that all new development should take place on a dedicated branch instead of directly on the `main` branch.

* **Process:**
    1.  Start from the `main` branch.
    2.  Create a new, descriptively named branch for the feature (e.g., `feature/user-login`).
    3.  Work and commit your changes on that feature branch.
    4.  When the feature is complete, open a Pull Request (or Merge Request) to merge it back into `main`.
    5.  After the feature is merged, delete the branch.
* **Best for:** Most teams of any size. It's simple, effective, and keeps the `main` branch stable.

### 2. GitFlow Workflow

GitFlow is a more structured and complex workflow designed for projects with scheduled release cycles. It defines strict roles for different branches.

* **Main Branches:**
    * `main`: Always represents the production-ready, released code.
    * `develop`: The integration branch for all completed features that are ready for the next release.
* **Supporting Branches:**
    * `feature/*`: Branched from `develop` for new features. Merged back into `develop`.
    * `release/*`: Branched from `develop` to prepare a new production release (for final testing and bug fixes). Merged into both `main` and `develop`.
    * `hotfix/*`: Branched from `main` to fix urgent production bugs. Merged into both `main` and `develop`.
* **Best for:** Projects with a defined release schedule (e.g., mobile apps, desktop software). It can be overkill for simpler projects or web apps with continuous deployment.

### 3. Forking Workflow

This workflow is most common in public open-source projects where many developers contribute, but only a few have direct write access to the main repository.

* **Process:**
    1.  A contributor "forks" the main repository on GitHub/GitLab, creating their own server-side copy.
    2.  They clone their fork to their local machine.
    3.  They create a feature branch and make their changes.
    4.  They push the feature branch to their own fork (not the original project).
    5.  They open a Pull Request from their fork's branch to the original project's `main` branch.
    6.  The project maintainers review, discuss, and merge the Pull Request.
* **Best for:** Open-source projects or any situation where you want to accept contributions from developers without giving them direct push access.
