# 4.7 Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even experienced developers run into confusing situations with Git. Here are some of the most common issues and how to resolve them.

### "Detached HEAD" State

* **What it is:** `HEAD` normally points to a branch (like `main`). In a "detached HEAD" state, `HEAD` points directly to a specific commit instead of a branch name. This usually happens when you `git checkout` a commit hash or a tag.
* **The Problem:** If you make new commits in this state, they don't belong to any branch. If you then switch to another branch, those new commits can become "lost" because no branch is tracking them.
* **How to Fix:**
    1.  **If you haven't made any new commits:** Simply switch back to a branch.
        ```bash
        git switch main
        ```
    2.  **If you have made new commits you want to keep:** Create a new branch right where you are. This will give your new commits a branch to belong to.
        ```bash
        git switch -c new-feature-branch
        ```
        You can then merge this new branch into `main` later.

### Recovering Lost Commits (`git reflog`)

* **What it is:** You've accidentally used `git reset --hard` or messed up a `rebase` and think you've lost commits forever.
* **The Solution:** `git reflog` is your ultimate safety net. It shows a log of every time your `HEAD` has moved, including commits, resets, checkouts, and merges. It tracks your local activity even for commits that are no longer part of any branch.
* **How to Use:**
    1.  View your reference log:
        ```bash
        git reflog
        ```
        You'll see a list like this:
        ```
        a1b2c3d HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
        e4f5g6h HEAD@{1}: commit: My important (but lost) commit
        ...
        ```
    2.  Find the hash of the commit you want to recover (e.g., `e4f5g6h`).
    3.  You can either create a new branch at that commit to inspect it:
        ```bash
        git switch -c recovered-work e4f5g6h
        ```
    4.  Or, if you are sure, you can reset your current branch back to that commit:
        ```bash
        git reset --hard e4f5g6h
        ```

### Dealing with Large Files (Git LFS)

* **The Problem:** Git is designed for text files, not large binary files (like videos, large images, datasets, or executables). Committing large files directly can bloat your repository, making it extremely slow to clone and work with.
* **The Solution:** Git Large File Storage (LFS). Git LFS is an extension that replaces large files in your repository with small text "pointer" files. The actual large files are stored on a separate server.
* **Basic Usage:**
    1.  Install Git LFS on your system.
    2.  Set it up in your repository: `git lfs install`
    3.  Tell LFS which file types to track:
        ```bash
        # Example for tracking all Photoshop files
        git lfs track "*.psd"
        ```
        This creates or updates a `.gitattributes` file, which you should commit.
    4.  Now, just `git add` and `git commit` your files as usual. LFS will handle the large files automatically.
