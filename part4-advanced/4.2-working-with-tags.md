# 4.2 Working with Tags

Git tags are like permanent, unmoving pointers to specific commits in your history. Unlike branches, which move forward with new commits, tags are designed to mark a specific point in time, most commonly for release versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0-beta`).

### Lightweight vs. Annotated Tags

Git has two main types of tags. For any official release, you should always use an annotated tag.

#### Annotated Tags (Recommended for Releases)
An annotated tag is a full object in the Git database. It contains the tagger's name, email, date, a tagging message, and can be GPG signed for security.

**How to create:**
```bash
# The -a flag signifies an annotated tag
# The -m flag provides the tagging message
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial stable release"
```
You can also tag a specific commit from the past by adding its hash:
```bash
git tag -a v0.9 -m "Release candidate" <commit_hash>
```

#### Lightweight Tags
A lightweight tag is just a simple pointer to a commit—it contains no extra information. It's like a branch that never moves. These are useful for temporary or private markers.

**How to create:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.1-alpha
```

### Managing Tags

**Listing Tags:**
```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# List tags matching a pattern
git tag -l "v1.8.*"
```

**Viewing Tag Details:**
The `git show` command displays the commit the tag points to, along with the tag's information if it's an annotated tag.
```bash
git show v1.0.0
```

---

### Pushing Tags to a Remote

By default, `git push` **does not** push your tags to the remote repository. You must push them explicitly.

**Push a specific tag:**
```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Push all tags at once:**
```bash
git push origin --tags
```

---

### Deleting Tags

* **To delete a local tag:**
    ```bash
    git tag -d v1.0.1-alpha
    ```
* **To delete a remote tag** (after deleting it locally):
    ```bash
    git push origin --delete v1.0.1-alpha
    ```
