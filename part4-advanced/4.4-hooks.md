# 4.4 Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that Git automatically executes before or after certain events, such as committing, pushing, or receiving pushed commits. They are a powerful tool for automating workflows, enforcing policies, and integrating with external systems.

Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks/` directory of your repository. When you initialize a repository, Git populates this directory with example scripts. To activate a hook, you simply remove the `.sample` extension from the filename and make it executable.

### Client-Side vs. Server-Side Hooks

* **Client-Side Hooks:** These run on your local machine and are triggered by local operations like `git commit` and `git push`. They are useful for checking your work before it's shared.
* **Server-Side Hooks:** These run on the remote repository's server and are triggered by network operations like receiving a push. They are used by repository administrators to enforce policies for the project.

> **Note:** Client-side hooks are local to your repository and are not versioned or pushed to the remote with your project. You cannot force your team members to use them. For team-wide policies, server-side hooks or CI/CD pipelines are the required solution.

### A Common Example: The `pre-commit` Hook

The `pre-commit` hook is one of the most popular client-side hooks. It runs *before* a commit is finalized, allowing you to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed.

**Common Use Cases:**
* **Run a Linter:** Check your code for style errors.
* **Run Unit Tests:** Ensure your changes haven't broken anything.
* **Check for Sensitive Information:** Prevent accidentally committing API keys or passwords.

If the `pre-commit` script exits with a non-zero status, the `git commit` command will be aborted, preventing the commit from being created.

**Example `pre-commit` Script (Shell Script):**
This simple script checks if you are accidentally trying to commit to the `main` branch.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ]; then
  echo "Error: You are not allowed to commit directly to the main branch."
  echo "Please create a feature branch and commit there."
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

To use this:
1.  Save it as `.git/hooks/pre-commit` in your repository.
2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
3.  Now, if you try to `git commit` while on the `main` branch, it will fail with the error message.
