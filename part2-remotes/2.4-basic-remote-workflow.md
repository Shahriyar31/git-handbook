# 2.4 Basic Remote Workflow

When collaborating with a team, it's essential to have a consistent workflow to avoid conflicts and keep the project history clean. Here is the most common daily workflow when working with a remote repository.

### The Pull -> Work -> Commit -> Push Cycle

This cycle is the foundation of collaborative development.

#### 1. Start Your Day with `git pull`

Before you start working on a new task, always make sure your local branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote. This prevents you from building on top of old code.

```bash
# Make sure you are on the main branch
git switch main

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main
```

#### 2. Create a Feature Branch (Optional but Recommended)

It's a best practice to create a new branch for every new feature or bug fix. This keeps your `main` branch clean and isolates your work. (We will cover branching in detail in Part 3).

```bash
git switch -c feature/user-authentication
```

#### 3. Do Your Work (Edit, Add, Commit)

Now you can work on your files. Make your changes, and commit them locally as you complete logical units of work.

```bash
# ... edit your files ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add user login form"

# ... do more work ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add password validation"
```

#### 4. Pull Again Before Pushing

This is a crucial step. Before you push your changes, someone else on your team might have pushed their own changes to the `main` branch. You need to integrate their changes into your branch first.

```bash
# Switch back to the main branch and pull the latest changes
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Switch back to your feature branch
git switch feature/user-authentication

# Merge the updated main branch into your feature branch
git merge main
```
*(If there are any conflicts, you'll need to resolve them here before continuing.)*

#### 5. Push Your Branch to the Remote

Once your feature is complete and you've integrated the latest changes from `main`, you can push your branch to the remote repository.

```bash
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```
After pushing, you can typically go to GitHub or GitLab to open a "Pull Request" or "Merge Request" to have your changes reviewed and merged into the `main` branch.
