# Part 2: Collaborating with Remote Repositories

In Part 1, everything you did was on your local machine. Now, it's time to learn how to share your work and collaborate with others. This part introduces "remote" repositories—versions of your project hosted on servers, typically on a service like GitHub.

We'll cover how to get code from a remote, how to push your changes for others to see, and how to pull in changes made by your teammates. This is the foundation of collaborative software development.
