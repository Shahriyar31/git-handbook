# 2.1 Introduction to Remote Repositories

Up until now, your Git repository has lived only on your local machine. This is great for personal version control, but it doesn't help when you need to:

* Collaborate with other developers.
* Back up your code in a safe, off-site location.
* Share your project with the world.

This is where **remote repositories** come in. A remote repository is essentially a copy of your Git repository hosted on a server, typically on a cloud-based service.

### What are GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket?

These are the most popular platforms for hosting Git repositories. They provide a web interface to manage your projects, track issues, review code, and collaborate with others.

* **GitHub:** The largest and most popular platform, widely used for open-source projects.
* **GitLab:** A comprehensive platform that, in addition to Git hosting, offers integrated tools for the entire software development lifecycle (often called DevOps).
* **Bitbucket:** Another popular platform, often chosen by teams that use other Atlassian products like Jira.

### The `origin` Remote

When you work with a remote repository, your local Git repository needs to know the remote's address (its URL). Git allows you to give short, memorable names to these URLs, and these are called "remotes".

By default, when you `clone` a repository, Git automatically creates a remote named **`origin`** that points to the URL you cloned from. This is the most common name for the primary remote repository.

You can check your configured remotes by running:
```bash
git remote -v
```
This command will show you the URLs associated with your remotes for both fetching (downloading) and pushing (uploading) changes.
