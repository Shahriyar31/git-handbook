# 2.3 Sending & Receiving Changes

Once you have a local repository connected to a remote, you'll constantly interact with it to share your work and get updates from others. The primary commands for this are `git push`, `git pull`, and `git fetch`.

---

### `git push`: Sending Local Commits to the Remote

The `git push` command is used to upload your local commits to a specified remote repository. This makes your changes available to your team and acts as a remote backup.

**Basic Syntax:**
```bash
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

**Example:**
After making some commits to your local `main` branch, you can push them to `origin`:
```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Setting an Upstream Branch (`-u`)

When you push a new branch for the first time, using the `-u` (or `--set-upstream`) flag is highly recommended. It creates a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.

```bash
# Pushing a new feature branch for the first time
git push -u origin feature/new-login
```

After setting the upstream, you can simply use `git push` from that branch in the future, and Git will know where to send the commits.

### `git pull`: Fetching and Merging Remote Changes

The `git pull` command is used to download new changes from a remote repository and automatically integrate them into your current local branch.

**Basic Syntax:**
```bash
git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

**Example:**
To update your local `main` branch with the latest changes from `origin`:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
If you have set an upstream branch, you can often just type `git pull`.

> **Important:** `git pull` is actually a combination of two other commands: `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.

---

### `git fetch`: Downloading Changes Without Merging

The `git fetch` command downloads new information (commits, branches, tags) from the remote repository but **does not** automatically merge them into your current branch.

**Why use `git fetch`?**
It allows you to see what changes have been made on the remote before you decide to merge them into your local work. This gives you more control.

**Common Workflow:**
1.  Fetch the remote changes:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```
2.  See what's different between your local `main` and the fetched `origin/main`:
    ```bash
    git diff main origin/main
    ```
3.  If you're happy with the changes, merge them:
    ```bash
    git merge origin/main
    ```

For beginners, `git pull` is often simpler. For more control, `git fetch` followed by `git merge` is a more deliberate and safer workflow.
