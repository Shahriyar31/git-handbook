# 2.5 Handling Merge Conflicts (Basic)

Merge conflicts are a normal part of working with Git in a team. They happen when Git cannot automatically combine changes from two different sources because the same lines of code have been modified differently.

Don't be afraid of conflicts! Git provides all the tools you need to resolve them.

### When Do Conflicts Happen?

The most common scenario is when you `git pull` or `git merge`, and both you and another person have edited the same lines in the same file.

**Example:**
* You and a colleague both start with the same version of a file.
* You change line 10 to say "Hello World".
* Your colleague changes line 10 to say "Hello Universe".
* Your colleague pushes their change first.
* When you `git pull`, Git sees the two different changes to the same line and doesn't know which one is correct. It stops and asks you to resolve the conflict.

### How to Identify and Resolve a Conflict

When a conflict occurs, Git will tell you in the terminal:
```
Auto-merging styles.css
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in styles.css
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

1.  **Open the Conflicted File:**
    Open the file mentioned (e.g., `styles.css`) in your code editor. Git will have inserted special markers to show you the conflicting sections:

    ```css
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    color: blue; /* Your local change */
    =======
    color: red; /* The incoming change from the remote */
    >>>>>>> origin/main
    ```
    * `<<<<<<< HEAD`: The beginning of your local changes.
    * `=======`: The separator between your changes and the incoming changes.
    * `>>>>>>> origin/main`: The end of the incoming changes.

2.  **Edit the File to Fix the Conflict:**
    You must manually edit the file to look exactly how you want it to look in the final version. This means deleting the Git markers (`<<<`, `===`, `>>>`) and choosing which code to keep. You might keep your version, the incoming version, or a combination of both.

    **Resolved Code:**
    ```css
    /* After discussion, we decided red is better. */
    color: red;
    ```

3.  **Stage the Resolved File:**
    After you have fixed the file and saved it, you need to tell Git that the conflict is resolved by staging the file.
    ```bash
    git add styles.css
    ```

4.  **Complete the Merge:**
    Once all conflicted files have been staged, you can complete the merge by creating a commit.
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```
    Git will open your text editor with a pre-filled merge commit message. You can usually just save and close it to finalize the commit.

You have now successfully resolved a merge conflict!
