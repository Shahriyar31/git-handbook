# 5.1 Writing Good Commit Messages

A good commit message is a critical part of your project's history. It explains **why** a change was made, which is far more valuable than *what* was changed (which Git can show you with `git diff`). Clear commit messages help you, your teammates, and your future self understand the project's evolution quickly.

A widely adopted convention for writing effective commit messages is to structure them with a subject and an optional body.

---

### The Subject Line (The First Line)

The subject line should be a concise summary of the change.

* **Use the Imperative Mood:** Write the subject as if you are giving a command.
    * **Good:** `feat: Add user login form`
    * **Bad:** `feat: Added user login form` or `feat: Adds user login form`
    * *A good rule of thumb is that your commit message should be ableto complete the sentence: "If applied, this commit will..."*

* **Capitalize the First Letter.**

* **Keep it Short:** Aim for 50-72 characters.

* **Do Not End with a Period.**

* **Use a Prefix (Optional but Recommended):** Many teams use prefixes to categorize commits.
    * `feat:` (A new feature)
    * `fix:` (A bug fix)
    * `docs:` (Documentation changes)
    * `style:` (Code style changes, like formatting)
    * `refactor:` (Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature)
    * `test:` (Adding or fixing tests)
    * `chore:` (Build process, tooling, or other maintenance changes)

---

### The Body (Detailed Explanation)

The body is optional for very simple changes, but highly recommended for anything non-trivial.

* **Separate with a Blank Line:** Always leave a blank line between the subject and the body.
* **Explain the "Why," Not the "How":** Describe the problem you were solving and the reason for your change. The code itself shows *how* you did it.
* **Wrap Lines:** Keep lines in the body wrapped at around 72 characters to make them easy to read in the terminal.

### Example of a Good Commit Message

```
feat: Add rate limiting to the login API

Adds rate limiting to the /api/login endpoint to prevent brute-force
password attacks. This closes issue #123.

- Implemented a limit of 5 failed login attempts per minute per IP.
- Returns a 429 "Too Many Requests" error once the limit is exceeded.
```
