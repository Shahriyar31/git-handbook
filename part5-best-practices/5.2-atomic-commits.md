# 5.2 Atomic Commits

An **atomic commit** is a single commit that represents one single, complete, and logically separate change. Think of it as the smallest sensible unit of work that can stand on its own.

Instead of committing all the changes you made over several hours in one large commit, you should break them down into smaller, atomic commits.

**Example:**
If you fix a bug, refactor some code, and add a new feature, these should ideally be **three separate commits**, not one.

### Why Atomic Commits are Important

* **Readability:** A history of small, well-defined commits is much easier to read and understand than a history of large, unrelated changes.

* **Reversibility:** If you need to undo a specific change, you can easily `git revert` a single atomic commit without affecting other unrelated changes that were made at the same time.

* **Code Review:** Smaller, focused commits are much easier and faster for teammates to review. This leads to better feedback and a more efficient review process.

* **Debugging (`git bisect`):** Git has a powerful debugging tool called `git bisect` that can automatically find which commit introduced a bug. This tool works best with a history of small,atomic commits.

### How to Achieve Atomic Commits

1.  **Commit Frequently:** Get into the habit of committing every time you complete a small, logical unit of work.

2.  **Use `git add -p` (Patch Mode):**
    If you've made several unrelated changes in the same file, you can use `git add -p` (or `git add --patch`). This will take you through each "hunk" of changes in your file and ask you if you want to stage it, allowing you to build up a commit piece by piece.

3.  **Plan Your Work:** Before you start coding, think about the logical steps involved. This can help you structure your work in a way that naturally leads to atomic commits.
