# 5.4 When to Commit, When to Push

Understanding the difference between `git commit` and `git push` is fundamental to an effective Git workflow. They are separate actions for a reason: one is for saving your work locally, and the other is for sharing it.

### When to Commit (`git commit`)

Committing saves a snapshot of your work to your **local repository's history**. It does not affect the remote repository until you push.

**You should commit frequently.**

* **After completing a logical unit:** Every time you complete a small, atomic unit of work (as discussed in Section 5.2), create a commit. This could be fixing a small bug, adding a single function, or updating a piece of documentation.
* **Before switching branches:** If you need to switch context to work on something else, commit your current work first (or `stash` it, as covered in Part 3). This ensures your changes are safely saved.
* **When your work is in a stable state:** Even if a feature isn't complete, commit your work when it's in a stable, non-breaking state. This creates a safe checkpoint you can return to.

Think of committing as pressing the "save" button in a video game. It's a local checkpoint that you can do as often as you like without affecting anyone else.

### When to Push (`git push`)

Pushing sends your local commits to the **remote repository**, making them available to your team.

**You should push deliberately.**

* **When you are ready to share:** Push your changes when your work is ready for others to see or when you need a collaborator to review it.
* **At the end of a work session:** It's good practice to push your committed work on a feature branch at the end of the day. This backs up your work on the remote server and allows others to see your progress if needed.
* **Before opening a Pull Request:** You must push your feature branch to the remote before you can open a pull request to merge it into `main`.
* **Crucially, always `pull` before you `push`:** On a shared branch like `main`, always run `git pull` to get the latest changes before you `push` your own. This allows you to resolve any potential merge conflicts on your local machine first.

Think of pushing as publishing your saved game progress to a public leaderboard for everyone else to see.
