# 5.3 Branch Naming Conventions

Consistent branch naming makes your repository's history more organized and understandable. When anyone on the team looks at the list of branches, they should be able to immediately understand the purpose of each one.

While there is no single standard enforced by Git, most teams adopt a convention.

### Common Branch Naming Patterns

A very popular and effective convention is to use a **type prefix** followed by a short, descriptive name.

#### Common Prefixes:

* **`feature/`**: For new features.
    * `feature/user-authentication`
    * `feature/payment-gateway`
* **`bugfix/`** or **`fix/`**: For bug fixes.
    * `bugfix/login-form-error`
    * `fix/incorrect-header-display`
* **`hotfix/`**: For urgent production fixes that need to be released quickly.
    * `hotfix/critical-api-vulnerability`
* **`chore/`**: For maintenance tasks, build process changes, or tooling updates that don't affect the user-facing code.
    * `chore/update-dependencies`
    * `chore/configure-ci-pipeline`
* **`docs/`**: For documentation updates.
    * `docs/update-readme`
* **`refactor/`**: For code restructuring that doesn't change external behavior.
    * `refactor/extract-auth-service`

### General Best Practices for Naming

1.  **Use Hyphens:** Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words. Avoid underscores (`_`) or camelCase.
    * **Good:** `feature/user-profile-page`
    * **Bad:** `feature/user_profile_page` or `feature/userProfilePage`

2.  **Be Descriptive but Concise:** The name should be long enough to be understood but short enough to be easily typed.

3.  **Use Lowercase:** It's a common convention to keep all branch names lowercase.

4.  **Include Issue/Ticket Number (Optional):** Many teams like to include the ID from their issue tracking system (like Jira or GitHub Issues) in the branch name.
    * `feature/123-new-login-flow`
    * `fix/456-api-timeout`
