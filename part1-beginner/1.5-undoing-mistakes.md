# 1.5 Undoing Mistakes (Beginner-Friendly)

Everyone makes mistakes! Git provides powerful tools to undo changes. For beginners, it's crucial to know the safe ways to undo things without risking your work.

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è 1.5.1 Discarding Unstaged Changes (`git restore <file>`)

If you've made changes to a file in your working directory and decide you want to abandon them (revert to the last committed version), `git restore` is your friend.

1.  **Make a Change:**
    Open a file (e.g., `INFO.md`) and add some messy, unwanted text.
    ```
    This is my project.
    Some temporary, ugly text here that I want to discard.
    ```

2.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    *(The output will show the file as modified but not staged.)*

3.  **Discard Changes:**
    ```bash
    git restore INFO.md
    ```
    Now, open `INFO.md` again. The messy text is gone! The file has been restored to its state at the last commit.

> **Historical Note:** Before Git 2.23, `git checkout -- <file>` was used for this purpose. `git restore` is newer and provides a clearer separation of concerns.

### üóëÔ∏è 1.5.2 Unstaging Changes (`git restore --staged <file>`)

If you accidentally `git add` a file to the staging area but then decide you don't want it included in the *next* commit, you can unstage it.

1.  **Make a Change and Stage It:**
    Add a new line to `INFO.md` and stage it.
    ```bash
    git add INFO.md
    git status
    ```
    *(The output will show `INFO.md` under "Changes to be committed".)*

2.  **Unstage the Change:**
    ```bash
    git restore --staged INFO.md
    ```
    Now, check `git status` again. `INFO.md` will be back under "Changes not staged for commit," meaning it's in your working directory but no longer in the staging area.

> **Historical Note:** Before Git 2.23, `git reset HEAD <file>` was commonly used for this. `git restore --staged` is the modern and clearer alternative.

### üìù 1.5.3 Amending the Last Commit (`git commit --amend`)

Sometimes you make a commit and immediately realize you made a mistake (e.g., a typo in the message, or you forgot to include a small change). `git commit --amend` allows you to *replace* the very last commit with a new, corrected one.

> **Important:** This command **rewrites history**. Only use it on commits that have **not yet been pushed** to a shared remote repository.

1.  **Amend the Commit Message:**
    Let's say your last commit message was `"feat: Add new featur"`.
    ```bash
    git commit --amend -m "feat: Add new feature"
    ```
    Git replaces the previous commit with a new one that has the corrected message.

2.  **Amend to Add Forgotten Changes:**
    Let's say you just committed, but realize you forgot to add a small change to `styles.css`.
    * First, make the change in `styles.css`.
    * Then, stage the forgotten change: `git add styles.css`
    * Now, amend the previous commit:
        ```bash
        git commit --amend --no-edit
        ```
        The `--no-edit` flag tells Git to use the *existing* commit message from the previous commit. The staged changes from `styles.css` will now be included in that last commit.
