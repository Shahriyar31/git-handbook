# 1.2 Setting Up Git

Before you can start using Git, you need to install it on your computer and configure it with your identity.

---

### üì• 1.2.1 Installation

Follow the instructions below for your operating system. After installation, open your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and verify Git is installed by typing:

```bash
git --version
```
You should see the Git version number (e.g., `git version 2.40.1`).

#### Windows
1. Download the Git for Windows installer from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Run the installer. The default options are usually fine for beginners, but ensure **"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"** is selected during the "Adjusting your PATH environment" step.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

#### macOS
* **Recommended (Xcode Command Line Tools):** Open your Terminal and type `git --version`. If Git isn't installed, macOS will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include Git. This is the easiest way.
* **Homebrew (For developers):** If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1.2.2 Initial Configuration (`git config`)

Now, tell Git who you are. This information will be associated with every commit you make, making it crucial for tracking changes in a team environment.

1.  **Set Your Name:**
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```
    *(Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.)*

2.  **Set Your Email:**
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    ```
    *(Replace "you@example.com" with the email you use for GitHub.)*

> The `--global` flag means these settings will apply to all Git repositories on your computer.

3.  **Set Your Default Text Editor (Optional but Recommended):**
    When Git needs you to write a longer commit message, it will open a text editor. You can configure your preferred editor:
    * **VS Code:** `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
    * **Sublime Text:** `git config --global core.editor "subl -w"`
    * **Nano:** `git config --global core.editor "nano"`

4.  **Verify Your Configuration (Optional):**
    You can view your current Git configuration settings:
    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```

You are now set up and ready to start using Git!
