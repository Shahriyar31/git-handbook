# 1.3 Your First Git Repository (Local Only)

Let's create your very first Git repository and understand the core concepts of how Git tracks changes. This entire section happens only on your local machine.

---

### ‚ú® 1.3.1 Creating a New Repository (`git init`)

To start tracking a new project with Git, you need to initialize a Git repository within your project's directory.

1.  **Create a Project Folder:**
    Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-first-git-project
    cd my-first-git-project
    ```
2.  **Initialize the Git Repository:**
    Inside your new project directory, run:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    You should see a message like: `Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-first-git-project/.git/`.

> This command creates a hidden `.git` subdirectory inside your project folder. This `.git` directory is the heart of your repository. It contains all the information Git needs to manage your project's versions and history. **Never directly modify or delete files inside the `.git` directory.**

### üìä 1.3.2 The Three States of Git

Git operates with three main "states" or "areas" for your files. Understanding this is crucial.

1.  **Working Directory:** This is your project folder where you actually create, modify, and delete files.
2.  **Staging Area (Index):** This is an intermediate area where you prepare changes for your next commit. You explicitly `add` the changes you want to include in your next snapshot.
3.  **Repository (.git directory):** This is where Git permanently stores your committed snapshots (versions) of the project history.

The typical workflow is: **Modify files** in your Working Directory -> **Stage files** with `git add` -> **Commit files** with `git commit`.

---

### üö¶ 1.3.3 `git status`: Checking Your Repository's State

The `git status` command is your best friend. It tells you the current state of your repository.

1.  **Create a New File:**
    Let's create a simple file named `README.md`.
    ```bash
    # You can use a terminal command or just your text editor
    echo "Hello, Git!" > README.md
    ```

2.  **Check the Status:**
    Now run `git status`:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    On branch master
    No commits yet
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```
    Git sees the new `README.md` file but tells you it is **"untracked"**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1.3.4 `git add`: Staging Changes

The `git add` command moves changes from your Working Directory to the Staging Area.

1.  **Stage `README.md`:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
    This tells Git, "I want to include the current version of `README.md` in my next commit."

2.  **Check `git status` Again:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    On branch master
    No commits yet
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md
    ```
    Now, Git shows `README.md` under **"Changes to be committed"**. It's in the Staging Area.

---

### üíæ 1.3.5 `git commit`: Saving Changes to History

Once changes are in the Staging Area, you use `git commit` to permanently save them as a snapshot in your repository's history.

1.  **Make Your First Commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README.md"
    ```
    The `-m` flag allows you to provide a short, descriptive **commit message**.

2.  **Check `git status` a Final Time:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ```
    This means all your changes are safely saved in the repository.

---

### üìú 1.3.6 `git log`: Viewing Commit History

The `git log` command displays the commit history of your current branch.

```bash
git log
```
Output:
```
commit e0e9b9c2b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 12 14:45:18 2025 +0200

    Initial commit: Add README.md
```
This shows your commit's unique hash, author, date, and message.
