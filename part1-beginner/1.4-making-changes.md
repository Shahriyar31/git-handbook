# 1.4 Making Changes & Tracking History

Now that you know how to make a basic commit, let's explore how Git handles modifications, additions, deletions, and renaming of files.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è 1.4.1 Modifying Files

1.  **Edit `README.md`:**
    Open `README.md` in your text editor and add a new line.
    ```
    Hello, Git!
    This is my first Git project.
    ```

2.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    On branch master
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    ```
    Git clearly indicates `README.md` has been `modified` but is "not staged for commit."

3.  **Stage and Commit:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "docs: Add second line to README"
    ```
    Verify with `git log`. You'll now see two commits in your history.

### ‚ûï 1.4.2 Adding New Files

1.  **Create a New File:**
    Create a file named `index.html` with some content:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Git Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my Git project!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    The output will show `index.html` as an `Untracked file`.

3.  **Stage and Commit:**
    ```bash
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "feat: Add basic index.html"
    ```
    Now `index.html` is part of your repository's history.

### ‚ûñ 1.4.3 Deleting Files

1.  **Delete a File:**
    Let's say you decide `index.html` is not needed.
    ```bash
    rm index.html   # On Windows, use `del index.html`
    ```

2.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Git detects that the file has been `deleted`.

3.  **Stage and Commit the Deletion:**
    You need to stage the deletion just like any other change.
    ```bash
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "refactor: Remove index.html"
    ```
> **Pro Tip:** You can also use `git rm index.html` directly, which deletes the file from the working directory *and* stages the deletion for you in one step.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 1.4.4 Renaming/Moving Files

Git doesn't explicitly track renames. Instead, it detects them by looking at the content. However, the `git mv` command helps Git understand your intent more clearly.

1.  **Rename a File:**
    Let's rename `README.md` to `INFO.md`.
    ```bash
    git mv README.md INFO.md
    ```

2.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    On branch master
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        renamed:    README.md -> INFO.md
    ```git mv` is a convenience command that renames the file and automatically stages the change.

3.  **Commit the Rename:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "docs: Rename README.md to INFO.md"
    ```

### üîç 1.4.5 Viewing Changes: `git diff`

The `git diff` command is essential for understanding what has changed.

* **`git diff` (Unstaged Changes):**
    Shows the differences between your **working directory** and the **staging area**.
    1.  Make a change to `INFO.md` but don't stage it.
    2.  Run `git diff`. You'll see your unstaged changes.

* **`git diff --staged` (Staged Changes):**
    Shows the differences between the **staging area** and your **last commit**.
    1.  Stage the change you just made: `git add INFO.md`
    2.  Run `git diff --staged`. Now you'll see the staged changes.

* **`git diff <commit1> <commit2>` (Differences Between Commits):**
    You can compare any two commits in your history. You'll need their commit hashes from `git log --oneline`.
    ```bash
    git diff <hash_of_commit1> <hash_of_commit2>
    ```
